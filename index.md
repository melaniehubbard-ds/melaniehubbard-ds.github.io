# DS Instruction and Project Examples
The following are examples of work I have done in the past, the intent being to help us have conversations about this kind of work and to possibly inspire new assignments, workshops, projects, etc. Many of the examples have an accompanying video that provide more contex. Some of the assignments I have designed or codesigned with faculty can be found in [Project CORA](https://www.projectcora.org/users/melanie-hubbard). More projects can be found at [ds.lmu.edu](https://ds.lmu.edu/).
